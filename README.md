# README Generator

## Description
Having written nearly a dozen READMEs at this point, I've done enough coding to understand that the process could be automated. This project was also a great initial endeavor to learn NodeJS, I worked with concepts like packages, the Command Line Interface of Inquirer, and exports between scripts. This project was also a lot of fun, as I learned about the landscape of licensing, copyright, and open-source through researching the different licenses used in the generator.

## Installation
This program uses a few different applications. Git Bash, NodeJS, and the Inquirer package within NodeJS. Once those are installed, download this repository.

## Usage
[Walkthrough Video](https://youtu.be/kEierHOZLas)

This application is very straight-forward and easy to use. When in the project folder, use "node index.js" as a command in the command line to begin. After this, input text after the prompts or choose from a list using the arrow keys and the enter button. The file will be added to the folder when finished.

Be aware, using the program again will overwrite any files of the same name "README.md" in that folder, so be sure to save a copy of each README you make before starting again.
